# Shakespeare Project

This is a work in progress!

Set in Elizabethan England, become a theatre manager, playwright and actor like Shakespeare! Discover the world of London, with its intrigues, dangers, and colourful characters. Perform in the great plays ever written in the English language while keeping your theatre afloat in turbulent times. Hire actors and commission plays, find props and set pieces, solicit patronage from the Royal Family, and even participate in the secret service of Queen Elizabeth I!

At the moment, we're working on 10 minutes of gameplay in a single quest to put on a short play in your home village with 2 or 3 interactable characters, a puzzle, and three possible endings.
